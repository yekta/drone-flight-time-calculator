This is a tool for calculating drone flight times for different types of batteries. It's not very accurate as you might imagine but it gives a rough estimate to get an idea.

Note: It's built using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) + [bolt.new](https://bolt.new) and a little bit of coding to fix some styles.
